Yii-Xero Invoice Examples
=========

The files in this folder are from a Yii implementation using the Yii-xero extension. 

Hopefully they will illustrate how to raise purchase and sales invoices from within Yii models.

Files:

* Invoice.php is the parent class for both sales and purchase invoices
* PurchaseInvoice.php is the model class for purchase invoices
* SalesInvoice.php is the model class for sales invoices
* InvoiceItem.php is the model for invoice items (for both types of invoice)
